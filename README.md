### 🚀 Hackathon Project | Team of 3

## 📌 Problem Statement

Street food vendors in India often rely on local middlemen to source raw materials. This leads to:
- Unfair pricing
- Lack of quality control
- Zero supplier transparency
- No verified ratings or trust system

**RawConnect** solves this by building a transparent, accessible platform to help vendors make smarter sourcing decisions.

---

## 🎯 Solution

RawConnect is a full-stack web platform where:
- 🧑‍🍳 **Vendors** can browse suppliers, compare prices, check quality ratings, and place bulk orders.
- 🏪 **Suppliers** can list products, upload certifications, and build trust.
- 🛡️ **Admins** verify suppliers, manage fraud prevention, and maintain platform trust.
